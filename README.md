This repository contains a study done on dimensionality reduction using the portuguese student scores dataset from UCI machine learning.
This respository contains two dimensionality reduction methods: PCA and Isomap, and documents the impact on linear regression performance based on number of dimensions chosen.
Furthermore, tests are provided for comparison on a similar math scores dataset to test the model's generalizability.
